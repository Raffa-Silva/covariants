### 22C (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.2.12.1" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="22C (Omicron)"/> appears to have arisen in late 2021 or early 2022, possibly in North America. As of April 2022, the vast majority of sequences of this lineage (>97%) have been detected in the USA.
<br/><br/>

As with all <WhoBadge name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="22C (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.
