### 21L (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.2" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<i>
<Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is part of a larger group, <b>21M (Omicron)</b>, which corresponds to Pango lineage <Lin name="B.1.1.529" />. <b>21M (Omicron)</b> includes <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, its sister-clade <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, and other diverse Omicron sequences. See the <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> page for more information. You can see a combined tree of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> <LinkExternal href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/21K.21L">here</LinkExternal>.
</i>
<br/><br/>

<Var name="21L (Omicron)" /> and <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> share 38 nucleotide and amino-acid mutations, but <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional 27, while <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional 20. 

Looking just at Spike, both share 21 amino-acid mutations, with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying an additional 12 unique amino-acid mutations and <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying an additional 6 (plus a deletion/mutation - see below). Notably, <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> lacks the deletion at <AaMut mut={'S:H69-'}/> and <AaMut mut={'S:V70-'}/> (see <Mut name="S:H69-"/>)) which cases the "S-gene drop out" or SGTF that has been used to track <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in TaqPath PCR tests. 

The 6 additional Spike mutations in <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> are: <AaMut mut={'S:T19I'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:V213G'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:S371F'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:T376A'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:D405N'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:R408S'}/>. 
On top of this, there is a 9 nucleotide deletion from position 21633-21641 which leads to the deletions and mutation <AaMut mut={'S:L24-'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:P25-'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:P26-'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:A27S'}/> (as with other deletion/mutations, this is sometimes alternatively reported as <AaMut mut={'S:L24S'}/>, followed by 3 deletions - the resulting protein is identical).
