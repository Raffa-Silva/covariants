### 22B (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.5" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="22B (Omicron)"/> likely arose in early 2022, possibly in South Africa. Early sequences are predominantly from South Africa, though it was detected more widely, particularly in Europe, by April 2022.

<br/><br/>

As with all <WhoBadge name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.
