### 23A (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="XBB.1.5" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="23A (Omicron)"/> likely arose at the end of 2022, possibly in North America. The first sequences date to late October 2022 and come from the north-east of the USA, but the variant has spread significantly since then.
<br/><br/>

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

<Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is a recombinant variant as it descends from <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, which is a recombination of lineage <Lin name="BJ.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.10.1.1"/>) (part of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>) and <Lin name="BM.1.1.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.75.3.1.1.1"/>) (part of <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>). 
<br/>
<br/>

Thus, <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same mutations as <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, with a few additional mutations, including <AaMut mut={"S:G252V"}/> and <AaMut mut={"ORF8:G8*"}/>. <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> also has an additional nucleotide mutation at position <NucMut mut="T23018C" />, which results in the <AaMut mut={"S:F486S"}/> in <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> becoming <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/>. This change from <code>S</code> to <code>P</code> has implications for ACE2 binding (see below).
<br/>
<br/>


Additionally, <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has a unique synonymous mutation at <NucMut mut="T17124C" />.

<!-- 
From the mutations and initial lab results, there is concern that <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may have an increased ability to evade existing immunity.
- A study looking at ability to neutralize <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in vaccinated and vaccinated individuals with <Who name="Omicron" /> breakthrough infections, found significant reduction in neutralization titers while maintaining ACE2 binding affinity ([Cao et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v4))
- The same study also found that <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> can escape the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) Evusheld and Bebtelovimab, making clinically available mAbs as of October 2022 likely ineffective against the variant. Additionally, <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> sublinages XBB.1 escaped all NTD-targeting neutralizing antibodies tested ([Cao et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v4))
