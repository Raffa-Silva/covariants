### 22A (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.4" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="22A (Omicron)"/> appears to have arisen in late 2021 or early 2022, possibly in South Africa. Early sequences are predominantly from South Africa, though it's now detected globally.
<br/><br/>

As with all <WhoBadge name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.
