### 20J (Gamma, V3)
Also known as <Lin name="P.1" /> and <Who name="Gamma" />
Announced in January 2021, <Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)"/> originated and/or initially expanded in Brazil ([Faria et al., Virological](https://virological.org/t/genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-manaus-preliminary-findings/586)), and was particularly associated with Manaus, Amazonas.
It has also been identified in travellers arriving in Japan from Brazil ([English Translation of Japanese NIID report](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&u=https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/diseases/ka/corona-virus/2019-ncov/10107-covid19-33.html), [Naveca et al., Research Square Preprint](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-275494/v1)).

<Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)" prefix=""/> is associated with multiple mutations in Spike. Notably: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> (see <Mut name="S:N501"/>), <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> (see <Var name="S:E484"/>).<br/>
But also <AaMut mut={'S:L18F'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:K417T'}/> and <AaMut mut={'S:H655Y'}/>. <br/>

There is also a mutation in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:P80R'}/> and the deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) at positions 3675-3677 (also seen in <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="20H (Beta, V2)" prefix=""/>, as well as some other variants of interest) (see <Mut name="ORF1a:S3675"/>).
It does _not_ have the deletion at 69/70.

- Convalescent plasma from individuals infected with non-Gamma variants had 6-fold reduced neutralization of Gamma compared to non-Gamma isolates. Additionally, plasma from CoronaVac (an inactivated vaccine) vaccinated patients appears to neutralise Gamma isolates less effectively than non-Gamma (though sample size was small) ([de Souza et al., Lancet Preprints](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3793486))
- Modelling work estimates that 20J (Gamma, V3) may be 1.7-2.4 times more transmissible ([Faria et al., Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/13/science.abh2644))
- The <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> mutation may help recover the decreased ACE2 binding observed with the <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> mutation, though this may also be overcome by other mutations (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253098v2.full-text">Amanat et al., medRxiv</LinkExternal>)
