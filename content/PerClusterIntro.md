In the graphs below, the proportion of **sequences** (_not cases_) from each country that are designated as being in that variant or having that mutation, are plotted.

Countries are displayed in the chart if the country has at least 600 sequences present in any variant or mutation.

Note the frequencies are displayed by week, but values are smoothed in order to dampen week-on-week jitter in sequencing.
